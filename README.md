# tleilax - a basic static site generator with minimal needs

This is the template for how I'm building small static sites with just a few HTML pages.

## Setup

1. Clone this repo
2. Install Docker
3. `dx/build`
4. `dx/start`
5. In another window:
   1. `dx/exec bin/setup`
   2. `dx/exec bin/dev`
6. Open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser
